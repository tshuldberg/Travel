**## Future Improvements ##**

- Down the line I would like to add aditions for users to be able to add their own photos to posts rather than a stock photo.  

- AAU I want to be able to add comments as well as reviews to posts and destinations in order to allow users to better evaluate where they want to go.

- AAU I want to be able to create a wish list that lets me set destinations that I want to go to and notes for each destination to help organize thoughts and wishes.

- I also want to seed the database with destinations in order to prevent duplicate destination ID's to help posts show as orginally was thought when viewing an individual destination.
